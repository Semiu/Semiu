### Hi there 👋! 

- 🧑‍💻 I'm a Software Engineer - Data and Machine Learning, with International Consulting Associates, Inc.
- 🌱😄 I enjoy making data more accessible to, and suitable for, machine learning and data analytics. I love designing data-intensive systems and data products - for insights, artificial intelligence, analytics, business or decision support. You name it!
- A non-deployed model does not impact the bottom line. It's, therefore, my job to take ML models into the system and monitor its continous performance.
- 🔭⚡ My academic research centers on the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, especially machine learning for software security. My current Ph.D. research is exploring machine and deep learning models for automated detection of security vulnerabilities in program source code.
